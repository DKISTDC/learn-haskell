Download and Install
* Clone repo
* GHCUP, cabal, haskell-language-server

Why Haskell?
* Code Fearlessly
* Type System
* Composition

Lesson1: Basics
* expressions: (2 + 3)
* parentheses: (2 + 3) * 4
* REPL / Reload
* functions: add, triple
* parentheses: fancyCalculation
* let/in: fancyCalculations
* where: count3Times
* Exercise

Lesson2: Strings and IO
* Lists of characters, type alias
* Printing, Hello World!
* (++), concat
* head, tail, take, drop
* IO / putStrLn, do
IO - do notation
* putStrLn / getLine
* pure expressions with let
* Tuples

Data Types
* ADTs
* Bool
* Tuples
* Domain-specific?
* Maybe
* Pattern matching / destructuring
* Sum / Product types
* Records?

Functional Programming
* Recursion
* Partial Application, Currying

Typeclasses
* Interfaces
* :info Eq
* :info Num
* Enum, Ord
* Show

Anonymous functions?
Case expressions?
Higher order functions
Guards
Function Composition with (.)

Recursion! Way down here
* factorial
* fibbonaci

Lists - again
* Finally goes into map
* filter
* zip

Folds 
* foldl
* scanl
